        My 10 year old brother recently talked about how he is having
        difficulties understanding the maths he's doing in class, so I thought I
        could try to help with that. That desire led to the making of this
        website, and hopefully other kids than just him will be able to use it
        as support in their future learning.
      </p>
      <p class="gap">
        In this website, you will find 5 different games I have made in order to
        help you, your child, or your student understand what I belive to be the
        the 5 basics of maths:
      </p>
      <div class="gap">
        <b class="mA-unit"> <a href="Jugs.html"> Addition </a> </b>
        <b class="mA-unit"><a href="Jugs.html"> Subtraction </a></b>
        <b class="mA-unit"><a href="Primes.html"> Multiplication </a></b>
        <b class="mA-unit"><a href="Cake.html"> Division </a></b>
        <b class="mA-unit"><a href="Stonks.html"> Percentages </a></b>
      </div>
      <p class="gap">
        These basics are present in the four games present on this site. Through
        playing these games you will learn how they function and hopefully
        become better at using them elsewhere in life.
